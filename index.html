            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am experienced in front-end programming as well as data analysis in the back-end. Outside of my business studies, I am pursing a Chinese
            minor to learn more about the language and cultural interactions. Currently I am preparing to take the Chinese HSK 4 test.</p>
            <p>I love encountering new experiences, enjoy challenging myself with knowledge outside of my field and will take any opportunity
            available to me. While I excel at working independently, I prefer working in a team as each member can bring fresh ideas to the table.
            During my free time, I enjoy photography, traveling, and running.</p>

                  As an intern, I completed four projects that mainly focused on using Microsoft Excel, the BI tool, Phocas, and Sugar CRM.
                  These projects allowed me to interact with co-workers in different branches and improved my understanding of the branches'
                  interrelation. My experience in China enabled me to adapt to the company work style quickly.

                  Having studied Chinese for three years, this experience allowed me to improve my cultural understanding of China.
                  The greatest difficulty was adapting to the difference in company hierarchy between Chinese companies and American companies.
                  Working at both reception and international trade branches allowed me to understand the responsibilities of each position.

                  teaching us new skills. Furthermore, I communicated with other branches to organize events to raise funds for TAMM. Through this,
                  the budget for the next semester was increased by 5%.

                  We decided to invite more speakers to attend our event because the number of committee members was increased.
